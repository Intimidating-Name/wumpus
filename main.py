YOU ARE A FAMOUS HUNTER DESCENDING DOWN INTO THE CAVES OF DARKNESS,
LAIR OF THE INFAMOUS MAN-EATING WUMPUS.  YOU ARE EQUIPPED WITH INFINITE
ARROWS, AND ALL YOUR SENSES.  THERE ARE TWENTY-FIVE CAVES CONNECTED
BY TUNNELS, AND THERE ARE TWO OTHER KINDS OF HAZARDS:
        A) PITS, WHICH ARE BOTTOMLESS, AND USUALLY FATAL TO FALL
        INTO.  THERE IS ONE SUCH PIT IN THE NETWORK.
        B) SUPER-BATS, WHICH IF YOU STUMBLE INTO THEIR ROOM WILL
        PICK YOU UP AND DROP YOU IN SOME RANDOM ROOM IN THE NETWORK.
        YOU MAY SHOOT SUPER-BATS, THERE IS ONE IN EACH OF THREE OR
        FOUR ROOMS WITHIN THE NETWORK.  THE SUPER-BATS GENERALLY STAY
        IN THEIR OWN ROOMS, EXCEPT WHEN DISPOSING OF INTRUDERS.
IF YOU BLUNDER INTO THE SAME ROOM AS THE WUMPUS, YOU LOSE....
THE NORMALLY SLEEPING WUMPUS DOES NOT MOVE (HAVING GORGED HIMSELF UPON
A PREVIOUS HUNTER).  HOWEVER ONE THING CAN WAKE HIM UP:
        WALKING INTO HIS ROOM,
THE WUMPUS IS TOO BIG TO BE PICKED UP BY SUPER-BATS AND HAS SUCKER FEET, SO HE DOESN'T
FALL INTO THE PITS.
YOU CAN SMELL THE WUMPUS FROM ONE ROOM AWAY. YOU CAN HEAR SUPER-BATS FROM
ONE ROOM AWAY, AND FEEL BREEZES (FROM BOTTOMLESS PITS) FROM ONE ROOM
AWAY.
TO SHOOT AN ARROW TYPE 's' INSTEAD OF A MOVE, AND THEN
SPECIFY WHICH ROOM THE ARROW SHOULD PASS THROUGH. YOU CAN ONLY SHOOT INTO THE NEXT ROOM.
SPECIFY AN IMPOSSIBLE PATH AND THE ARROW WILL NOT SHOOT.
EACH ROOM IS CONNECTED TO FOUR OTHER ROOMS BY FOUR TUNNELS.  
YOU MUST ALWAYS MOVE BETWEEN ROOMS BY SPECIFYING WHICH
TUNNEL YOU WISH TO EXPLORE.  YOU CAN ALWAYS RETRACE YOUR FOOT STEPS
BY MOVING BACK USING THE SAME TUNNEL DESIGNATOR.
                GOOD LUCK HUNTING!!
